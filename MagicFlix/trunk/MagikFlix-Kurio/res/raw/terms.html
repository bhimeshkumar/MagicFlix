							In some cases, you may be asked to agree to revised terms when

							agree to revised terms you will not be allowed to use the
							Services. Your continued use of all or any part of the Services
							following posting or other notice of changes to these Terms as
							described below will mean you accept those changes. Unless we let
							you know by posting the changes to these Terms or otherwise
							giving you notice, any new features or updated content or
							applications that we make available in connection with the
							Services will be subject to these Terms.</p>
						<h5></h5>

							presentation of the Services.</p>

						<p>On some parts of our Services or otherwise in connection
							with your use of the Services, you may be allowed to submit, post
							or link to content or applications or provide comments for others
							to see (collectively, referred to herein as “Content”). If you
							submit, post, link to or contribute Content, you guarantee,
							represent and warrant to us that:</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<ol>
							<li>You have all necessary legal rights to submit, post,
								contribute or link to such Content and it does not and will not
								infringe or violate any law or the rights of any person;</li>
							<li>While you or the rightful owner of the Content retain
								all ownership rights in the Content, you give us (and have the

								we believe doing so will improve the Services. We can also
								suspend or terminate use of the Service by anyone who does not
								follow these Terms. Nevertheless, you understand that by using
								the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive or
								objectionable.</li>
						</ol>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Conduct of users</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>We believe that all users benefit from basic rules
							regarding conduct while using the Services. Widespread use and
							enjoyment of the Services is jeopardized when a few individuals
							act irresponsibly. To help everyone have a positive experience,
							we ask, and you agree, to follow the following basic rules of
							conduct when using the Services:</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<ol>
							<li>You will follow these Terms and all applicable laws;</li>

							<li>You will not harass, threaten or abuse other people when

								of the Services;</li>

								and absolute opinion of Magikflix, results or may result in any
								user of the Services being scammed or defrauded in any way in
								connection with such user’s use of the Services;</li>
							<li>You will not upload, post, email or otherwise make
								available any Content that is obscene or may be hateful or
								offensive on racial, ethnic, sexual or any other grounds; is

								including any patent, trademark, trade secret, or copyrights of
								any party;</li>
							<li>You will not use or exploit any errors in design,
								features which have not been documented, or “bugs” to gain

							<li>You will not attempt to harvest any user names or email
								addresses from the Services for any purpose;</li>
							<li>You will not collect or store personal information about
								any other individual on the Services, or otherwise stalk,
								repeatedly contact or harass another user;</li>
							<li>You will not impersonate any other person or
								misrepresent a relationship with any person or entity, including
								misrepresenting a relationship with Magikflix; similarly, you
								will not adopt a false identity if the purpose of doing so is to
								deceive or defraud another;</li>
							<li>You will not use the Services to harm minors in any way,
								or encourage interactions with minors of a sexual nature;</li>
							<li>You will not manipulate the Services so as to hide your
								identity or participation in the Services (by using another

								other possible identifier);</li>
							<li>You will not post any Content that contains any viruses,
								cancel bots, Trojan horses, harmful code, or other computer
								programs or code designed to interrupt the Services, the ability
								of users to enjoy the Services, or the proper functioning of any
								software, hardware or equipment or materials used in connection
								with the Services; and</li>
							<li>You will not send any bulk unsolicited advertising,
								promotional information, email or other solicitation (including
								without limitation junk mail, “spam,” chain letters or pyramid
								schemes of any sort) to any person through the use of the
								Services.</li>
						</ol>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>If you violate any of the guidelines set forth above, or
							any other aspect of these Terms, we reserve the right to suspend
							or terminate your rights to use the Services without giving you
							any notice. In the event that your rights to use the Services are
							terminated, you will immediately lose access to any information
							that may be on the system.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>We can terminate your access to the Services at any time.
							We may also remove any Content that you post without cause and
							without notice to you.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>You understand that magikflix is not responsible for your
							inability to access any information on the service for any
							reason, whether because of termination of your account; software,
							hardware, or internet problems or errors; or any other reason.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Intellectual property</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>Magikflix reserves all rights not expressly granted in the
							Agreement and disclaims the grant of any implied rights to you.
							The Services are owned by Magikflix or its licensors, as
							applicable, and protected by applicable law, with all rights
							reserved. The entire content (images and text) of the Services is
							copyrighted and may not be reproduced, published, broadcast,
							posted, modified, transmitted, displayed, distributed, downloaded
							or otherwise used without the express written permission of
							Magikflix. Except for allowing you to use the Services for your
							personal use as set forth in these Terms, when you use the
							Services you are not receiving a license or any other rights from
							us, including intellectual property or other proprietary rights
							of Magikflix or its licensors. You understand that you have no
							rights to the Services or any other property of Magikflix or its
							licensors except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>Magikflix takes the protection of intellectual property
							rights, including copyrights, very seriously. Magikflix will
							terminate your access to, or use of, all or any part of the
							Services, without notice to you, if you infringe or
							misappropriate the intellectual property rights, including
							copyrights, of others. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium
							Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 501 et seq.,
							copyright owners or their authorized agents may submit a
							complaint of alleged copyright infringement to Magikflix if they
							have a good-faith belief that their protected works are being
							infringed.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>To be effective, the notification must be a written
							communication that includes:</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<ul>
							<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person
								authorized to act on behalf of the owner of a right that is
								allegedly infringed;</li>
							<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have
								been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single
								site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
								of such works at such site;</li>
							<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be
								infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that
								is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and
								information reasonably sufficient to permit the provider to
								locate the material;</li>
							<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the provider
								to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone
								number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which
								the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
							<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith
								belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is
								not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
								and</li>
							<li>A statement that the information in the notification is
								accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining
								party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
								exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>Upon receipt of such notification, Magikflix shall promptly
							investigate the matter, and, if appropriate, remove or disable
							access to the allegedly infringing material. After Magikflix
							removes or disables access to such material, if such material was
							posted by a user of the Service, Magikflix will notify the party
							that posted the material of its action. Such party may then
							provide Magikflix’s designated agent proper
							“counter-notification” stating his, her or its authority to post
							the allegedly infringing material, which Magikflix will forward
							to the alleged copyright owner. Magikflix will inform the alleged
							copyright owner that Magikflix will repost the removed material
							or cease disabling access to it in 10 to 14 business days unless
							the alleged copyright owner sends a second notification to
							Magikflix’s designated agent stating that it has filed suit
							against the alleged infringer.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>An effective counter-notification must be sent to
							Magikflix’s designated agent, whose name and address are listed
							above. The notice must include the following information:</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<ul>
							<li>The counter-notifying party’s physical or electronic
								signature;</li>
							<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or
								disabled and the location where the material was before its
								removal or disablement;</li>
							<li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the party
								has a good faith belief that the material was removed or
								disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification; and</li>
							<li>The counter-notifying party’s name, address, phone
								number, and a statement that the party consents to the
								jurisdiction of the federal court in its district, or if the
								subscriber is foreign, it consents to any jurisdiction where
								Magikflix is subject to jurisdiction, and that the subscriber
								will accept service of process from the person who provided
								Magikflix with notification or an agent of such a person.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Indemnity</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>You understand that you are personally responsible for your
							behavior while using the services and for all content provided
							via your account, and agree to indemnify and hold Magikflix and
							its affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and
							agents harmless from and against any loss, damage, liability,
							cost or expense of any kind (including attorneys’ fees) that we
							may incur in connection with a third party claim or otherwise, in
							relation to your use of the services, the content you contribute
							or link to, or your access to the services, or your violation of
							either these terms or the rights of any third party.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Warranty disclaimer</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>You understand that your use of the services is at your
							sole risk (including any downloads from the services and any loss
							of data or other damage to your computer system or mobile device
							you experience from using the services). You understand that the
							services and all information, applications, products and other
							content (including third party information, applications products
							and content) included in or accessible from the services, are
							provided on an “as is” “where-is” and “where available” basis,
							and are subject to change at any time without notice to you. You
							acknowledge that magikflix makes no warranty that the services
							will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. You
							understand that magikflix does not warrant that the results
							obtained from your use of the services will meet your
							expectations. No warranty of any kind, whether oral or written,
							can modify the terms of the disclaimer set forth in this
							document.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, magikflix disclaims
							all representations, warranties and conditions of any kind
							(express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including but not
							limited to the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
							particular purpose, title and non-infringement of proprietary
							rights) as to the services and all information, applications,
							products and other content (including third party information,
							applications, products and content) included in or accessible
							from the services. The limitations, exclusions and disclaimers in
							this section and elsewhere in these terms of service apply to the
							maximum extent permitted by applicable law. With respect to users
							who access the site in certain jurisdictions, this section does
							not affect your statutory rights as a consumer under applicable
							law.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Liability disclaimer</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
							event will magikflix or its affiliates be liable to you (or any
							third party making claims through you) for any damages
							whatsoever, including but not limited to any direct, indirect,
							special, consequential, punitive or incidental damages, or
							damages for loss of use, profits, data or other intangibles, or
							the cost of procurement of substitute goods or the services,
							unauthorized access to and tampering with your personal
							information or transmissions, arising out of or related to the
							use, inability to use, unauthorized use, performance or
							non-performance of the services or magikflix, even if magikflix
							has been advised previously of the possibility of such damages
							and whether such damages arise in contract, negligence, tort,
							under statute, in equity, at law or otherwise. The limitations,
							exclusions and disclaimers in this section and elsewhere in these
							terms of service apply to the maximum extent permitted by
							applicable law.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>With respect to users who access the site in certain
							jurisdictions, this section does not affect your statutory rights
							as a consumer under applicable law.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Third party services; recommendations</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>The Services may contain links to other sites, applications
							or content, which links may appear to embed the sites,
							applications or content hosted or provided by third parties into
							the interface of the Services. Your use of such other sites,
							applications or content is subject to the Terms of Service, if
							any, governing the use of such sites, applications or content.
							Magikflix is not able to control these third party sites,
							applications or content, and assumes no responsibility for their
							subject matter, privacy policies, or practices. If there is any
							conflict between the Terms set forth herein and any terms or
							notices set forth with respect to any sites, applications or
							content provided by any third parties, then the terms of such
							third party sites, applications or content will control your use
							of such sites, applications or content. Please review the Terms
							of Service and Privacy Policy for each third party provider of
							sites, applications or content so that you understand all of the
							terms that will apply. By using the Services, you expressly
							relieve Magikflix from any and all liability arising from your
							use of any third-party sites, applications or content.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>From time to time, the Services may include reviews and
							recommendations for applications, content or other products or
							services provided by third parties. Magikflix makes such
							recommendations based on a review process and Magikflix does not
							receive compensation from developers for recommending third party
							applications. While we strive to review the material thoroughly,
							we cannot review all the material, information and content
							related to or available through third party applications, content
							or other products or services that we recommend. Accordingly,
							Magikflix cannot be responsible for any harm whatsoever resulting
							from your use of any third party applications, content or other
							products or services recommended by Magikflix.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other
							legal notices published by Magikflix on our website, in our Apps,
							or delivered to you by us via email, shall constitute the entire
							agreement between you and Magikflix. They supersede any and all
							prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Magikflix
							relating to your use of the Services. Some parts of the Services
							may have special terms that apply, like subscription-based Apps,
							rules for particular contests or sweepstakes or other features or
							activities. Any such special terms contained in any legal notice
							published or delivered by Magikflix are in addition to these
							Terms, and in the event of a conflict, prevail over these Terms
							with respect to that particular part of the Services.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or
							unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these
							Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. No
							waiver of any right or provision of these Terms will be deemed a
							further or continuing waiver thereof or any other right or
							provision, and Magikflix’s failure to assert any right or
							provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
							right or provision. These Terms of Service take effect as a
							legally binding agreement and separately as a notice which limits
							the basis on which Magikflix makes the Services available.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to change
							these Terms at any time (including by modification, deletion
							and/or addition of any portion thereof), and your continued use
							of the Services after notice of any change we make will mean that
							you agreed with the changes. Notice to you may be made by
							displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the
							Services. If we make a material amendment to these Terms of
							Service, we will also notify you of such amendment by sending you
							an email at the last email address that you provided us and by
							posting notice of such amendment on our website. Any such
							material amendment to these Terms will be effective 30 calendar
							days following either our sending email notice to you or our
							posting of notice of the changes on our website. Please note that
							you are responsible for updating your personal information to
							provide us your current email address at all times. In the event
							that the last email address that you have provided us is not
							valid, or for any other reason is not capable of delivering to
							you the notice described above, our sending of the email
							containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective
							notice of any amendment described in the notice.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>In the event that you do not agree to any of these terms,
							you may not access or use the services for any purpose.</p>
						<h5></h5>
						<p>Date of Last Modification: January 30, 2014</p>
